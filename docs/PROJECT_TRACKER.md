  - **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Repositioned banner below navigation
    - Banner top position: 0 → 60px (below nav height)
    - Adjusted z-index: 2000 → 1500 (lower than navigation)
    - Updated body padding: 50px → 110px (nav + banner height)
    - Fixed mobile padding: 65px → 125px (nav + mobile banner)
    - Updated JS to properly reset padding when banner hides
  - **RESULT**: Navigation fully accessible, banner positioned correctly below nav
- **2024-06-23**: Countdown banner visual hierarchy optimization

  - **UX IMPROVEMENT**: Timer is now the hero element with supporting context
- **2024-06-23**: Banner repositioning for top placement and horizontal layout
  - **BANNER POSITION**: Moved to very top of screen (above navigation)
    - Banner top: 60px → 0 (at very top of viewport)
    - Navigation pushed down with top: 35px to account for banner
    - Z-index back to 2000 to ensure banner stays above navigation

    - Removed flex-direction: column → back to horizontal row
    - Timer first, then launch text, all in one thin line
    - Reduced banner padding to 4px for subtle, thin appearance
  - **RESPONSIVE HANDLING**: Optimized for thin banner design
    - Mobile still stacks vertically due to space constraints
    - Adjusted body padding: 110px → 95px (35px banner + 60px nav)
    - Updated JavaScript to properly reset nav position when banner hides
  - **RESULT**: Thin, subtle banner at very top with timer-first horizontal layout
- **2024-06-23**: CRITICAL FIX - Conflicting navigation CSS rules
  - **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: Duplicate nav CSS rules causing navigation positioning conflicts
    - Added nav rule with top: 35px was being overridden by original nav rule with top: 0
    - This created gap between banner and navigation
  - **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Fixed original nav CSS instead of adding duplicate
    - Modified main nav rule: top: 0 → top: 35px (sits directly below banner)
    - Removed duplicate nav rule that was conflicting
    - Navigation now properly positioned with no gap below banner
  - **RESULT**: Clean banner → navigation → content flow with no gaps
- **2024-06-23**: Banner height refinement for more subtle appearance
  - **USER REQUEST**: Make countdown banner 20% thinner for more subtle presence
  - **IMPLEMENTATION**: Reduced banner padding and adjusted positioning
    - Banner padding: 4px → 3px (20% reduction)
    - Navigation position: top: 35px → top: 32px (accounts for thinner banner)
    - Body padding: 95px → 92px (32px banner + 60px nav)
    - Mobile padding: 110px → 107px (proportional adjustment)
  - **RESULT**: Even more subtle, thin countdown banner that doesn't dominate the page
- **2024-06-23**: COMPLETE FIX - Disabled navigation scroll effects
  - **ISSUE**: Navigation was still moving/changing when scrolling despite CSS fixes
    - JavaScript scroll event was adding/removing "scrolled" class

  - **SOLUTION**: Completely disabled scroll effects for navigation
    - Removed scroll event listener JavaScript entirely
